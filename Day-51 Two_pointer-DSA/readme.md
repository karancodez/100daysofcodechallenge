#Explanation

In a sorted array, the elements are in order, which allows the two pointers to move through the array in a specific direction (usually from left to right) and take advantage of the sorted nature of the data.
Here is an example of a two-pointer algorithm for finding a pair of elements in a sorted array that sum to a given value:

#SUDO code
Initialize two pointers, left and right, to the first and last elements of the array, respectively.
While left is less than or equal to right:
Calculate the sum of the elements pointed to by left and right.
If the sum is equal to the target value, return the pair of elements.
If the sum is less than the target value, increment left.
If the sum is greater than the target value, decrement right.
If no pair is found, return null or a sentinel value indicating that no pair was found.
This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, making it an efficient solution for finding a pair of elements that sum to a given value in a sorted array.
Two-pointer algorithms can also be used to find the longest increasing or decreasing subarray in a sorted array, or to perform other operations that take advantage of the sorted nature of the data. They can provide a more efficient solution than other approaches, particularly when the array is large or the operations being performed are complex.

#Python

def targetSum(num, target):
  L, R = 0, len(num) - 1
  while L < R:
    if num[L] + num[R] > target:
      R -= 1
    elif num[L] + num[R] < target:
      L += 1
    else:
      return [L, R]


print(targetSum([-1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9], 7))

#JavaScript

function targetSum(nums, target) {

  let L = 0, R = nums.length - 1;
  while (L < R) {
    if (nums[L] + nums[R] > target) {
      R--;
    } else if (nums[L] + nums[R] < target) {
      L++;
    } else {
      return [L, R];
    }  
  }
  return null;
}

#Java

public static int[] targetSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    int L = 0, R = nums.length - 1;
    while (L < R) {
      if (nums[L] + nums[R] > target) {
        R--;
      } else if (nums[L] + nums[R] < target) {
        L++;
      } else {
        return new int[] {L, R};
      }  
    }
    return null;
  } 
}
